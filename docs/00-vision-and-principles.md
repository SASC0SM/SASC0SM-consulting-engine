- energy-finance convergence for real economic productivity

## Core Principles

### 1. Sovereignty First
Clients must retain agency over identity, assets, and data. We avoid extraction models.

### 2. Bitcoin as the Base Layer
Bitcoin is the neutral, global monetary anchor.
We use it as the reference rail for value, incentives, and alignment.

### 3. No Surveillance Dependency
We do not build systems that require surveillance to function.
Default is minimal data collection, progressive disclosure, and strong security.

### 4. Practical Adoption Pathways (BAF-Aligned)
We do not “pitch ideology.”
We map adoption stages and implement steps that create measurable outcomes.

### 5. Energy-Finance Convergence
Economic productivity is bounded by energy.
We prioritize infrastructure that merges energy strategy with financial rails.
