# Scoring Model — Digital Sovereignty Intake

This document defines how inbound leads are scored, routed, and actioned inside the SASCOSM Consulting Engine.

The goal is to:
- eliminate low-signal engagements,
- fast-track high-leverage opportunities,
- preserve sovereign time and positioning.

---

## Overview

Each inbound submission is scored across **six dimensions**.

Scores determine:
- eligibility for the paid Diagnostic,
- fast-lane vs standard delivery,
- recommended next-tier engagement.

## Hard Disqualifiers (Override)

Regardless of score, reject or deflect if:

---

## Strategic Exceptions

Allowed **only** if:
- Political / geographic leverage
- Ecosystem multiplier effect
- Long-term Bitcoin adoption value

These require manual override.
